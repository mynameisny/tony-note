I believe:

- Good systems are the result of long-term maintenance
- So is a good life

I enjoy documenting and organizing—
 treating life itself as a long-term project under continuous maintenance.

What you’ll find here are traces left as I move back and forth
 between the technical world and the real one.

Updates are irregular,
 but a long silence usually means I’m still alive.
